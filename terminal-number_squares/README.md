**Number Squares** is a lightweight terminal-based C++ application that generates a continuously refreshing grid of **random two-digit numbers**.  
Merely an exploration in creative coding.

---
## How It Works

1. The program first asks for your preferred grid size (between **5–20**).
2. Once confirmed, it generates a grid of random numbers between **10–99**.
3. The grid continuously updates until the application is manually closed (e.g., via **Ctrl + C**).
4. If you choose **“N”**, the program exits gracefully with a farewell message.

3. Grid updates until application is manually closed.
4. If you chose `N`, the program exits with a farewell message.

If you already have the compiled executable:
```bash
./app.exe
